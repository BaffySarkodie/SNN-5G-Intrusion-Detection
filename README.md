# SNN-5G-Intrusion-Detection
Investigation of SNN model Performance on 5G Data Traffic Intrusion Detection Task

This research explores the use of Spiking Neural Networks for intrusion and anomaly detection on 5G networks. Using a 5G network traffic dataset, an Enhanced Elman Spiking Neural Network was built to perform a classification task on the dataset. The model 
achieved accuracy, recall, precision, and recall values of 83%, 85%, 84% and 84% respectively. The modelâ€™s performance was compared to a traditional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network and proved to train and evaluate the data in a significantly lesser time span. The results show Spiking Neural Networks can be useful in the detection of intrusions on a 5G network.
